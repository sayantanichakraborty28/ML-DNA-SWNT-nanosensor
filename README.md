#ML model predicting optical responses of our DNA-SWNT nanosensor to catechol derivative molecules.
1. fingerprints_SVR_training.ipynb is used to train regression ML models using SVR algorithm and linear, rbf and sigmoid kernels. The ML models differ from each other in terms of the molecular fingerprints used to encode the molecular structures in the model. 200 random models are trained and the r2 score for each of these models are printed in a file. This enables us to choose the best combination of kernels and fingerprints for accurate predictions based on high r2 score values.
2. reg_prediction_homolumo.ipynb is used to employ the the best fingerprint-kernel combinations selected in the previous step to train on a dataset of 63 molecules, the five best models with best r2 score values are then saved and used to perform a blind test-make predictions of optical responses for 21 new molecules. 
3. Violinplot_NL_nanosensor.ipynb is used to make violinplots for comparing the various ML predictions.
